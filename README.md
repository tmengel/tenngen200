# TennGen200
Adaptation of TennGen for 200 GeV Au-Au collisions. Random number generation of heavy ion collisions based off sampling measured charged particle momentum spectra, particle flow coefficents and charged particle multiplicty at RHIC. Implements Van-Neuman method of accept/rejection to speed up event generation.

Current Features:
- |#eta| < 1.1.
- Harmonic coefficents: #v_1, #v_2, #v_3, #v_4.
- All charged particles: #pi^{#pm}, #k^{#pm}, p and #bar{p}.
- Variable particle multiplicities.
- Centrality binning: 0-10%, 10-20%, 20-40%, 40-60%.

Quick start:
1) Change <export ROOTDIR=[YOUR_ROOT_DIRECTORY]/lib> to your local root install directory in <tenngen-config> file.
2) <chmod +x tenngen-config>
3) <./tenngen-config>

This will make the tenngen library and create an AuAu200Data.root file in your </examples> directory. This root file is nessicary to run any TennGen200 event generation. If you delete this file, it can be regenerated by an exicutable <./share/TennGen200/AuAuData>. 

Examples of using TennGen can be found in </examples>.

Datafiles and fitted distributions can be located in </share/data>. There is also png files of the current fits of momentum distributions and multiplicty distribution in <./share/distros-PNG>.
